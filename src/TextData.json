Regular maintenance prevents moss from causing long-term damage to your shingles."},{"question":"Is pressure washing safe for my siding?","answer":"For delicate surfaces like vinyl siding, stucco, or painted wood, we use a technique called soft washing. It uses low pressure combined with specialized cleaning solutions to safely remove dirt and algae without risking damage."},{"question":"Do you service areas outside of Duncan?","answer":"Yes, our primary service area is Duncan and the greater Cowichan Valley. Please contact us with your address to confirm if you are within our service range."},{"question":"How do I get a price for my property?","answer":"All our pricing is based on a custom quote.
